# Student Test Portal

A web application where students can take tests that are uploaded and managed by a teacher.

## High-level idea
- Teacher uploads tests (questions, options, answers, scheduling).
- Students log in, see assigned tests, and submit answers.
- Teacher can review results and basic statistics.
